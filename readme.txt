The program is a solver for anagrams and crosswords. In can be run in 2 modes, anagram mode using the flag -a or crossword mode using -c, if you choose to run it without a second argument it will close. The program reads from /usr/share/dict/american to get its dictionary and expects one word per line. It will continue until you enter 'q' to quit. The linked lists at each node are not sorted. This allows for much faster reading of the dictionary to start with and since the dictionary is sorted to begin with they will be in (reverse) alphabetical order since the linked list adds at the head.
